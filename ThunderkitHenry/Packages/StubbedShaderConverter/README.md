# Stubbed Shader Converter

This is a [ThunderKit created](https://github.com/risk-of-thunder/R2Wiki/wiki/Creating-Mods-with-Thunderkit) external tool for converting stubbed shaders into Hopoo equivelents, and is primarily a tool for other mod developers.  
Using StubbedShaderConverter within your mod will require a `Soft/HardDependency`, as StubbedShaderConverter must load before your mod loads.  

Information on how to use this as a mod developer can be found within [the Github](https://github.com/Vale-X/StubbedShaderConverter).
