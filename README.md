# Thunderkit-Henry (EARLY RELEASE)
**This is an EARLY RELEASE of ThunderHenry, a ThunderKit based template for survivors. This template DOES NOT have WWise setup, meaning custom sounds are NOT POSSIBLE with this version of the template. A future release will have WWise support.**

See the [ThunderHenry Wiki](https://github.com/Vale-X/Thunderkit-Henry/wiki/Creating-Survivors-with-ThunderHenry) for a WORK IN PROGRESS tutorial on how to use this template, and how to create ThunderKit survivors in general.
